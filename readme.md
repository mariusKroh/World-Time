## About

This project grew from the idea of experimenting with a simple CSS clock in JavaScript. My aim was to apply what I have learned over the last weeks while deepening my frontend knowledge. For educational purposes I set the rule to not use any external libraries or frameworks.\*
If you happen to stumble upon this and want to submit a pull request/report issues: Go for it! â˜º

##### Concepts I utilized

- Basic functional programming
- ES6 Syntax, array methods
- Event handling & delegation
- Fetch API
- DOM Manipulation with dynamic content
- SASS/SCSS
- RWD
- Basic Git workflow via CLI

## \*Problems/Issues

I ran into a lot of smaller issues & gnarly feeling workarounds due to the limitations I set for myself when creating this project. However, it wasn't until I tried implementing the DST feature when I realised that it's just not worth the hassle continuing with these limitations. The ideal solution for me is to rewrite most of the code:

1. Use [another](https://github.com/dmfilipenko/timezones.json)[timezone.JSON](http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone) for displaying the data.
2. Rewrite search & display suggestions functionality.
3. Rewrite set & make clock functionality while implementing DST, AM/PM & others.
4. [Use Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) as working with time objects can be super hard to wrap your head around and very confusing.

## Todo
