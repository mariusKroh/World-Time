## About

This project grew from the idea of experimenting with a simple CSS clock in JavaScript. My aim was to apply what I have learned over the last weeks while deepening my frontend knowledge. I made the rule to not use any libraries or frameworks for this since good vanilla JS knowledge seems fundamental for the understanding of further concepts to me.

#### Concepts I utilized

###### JS

- Basic functional programming
- ES6 Syntax
- Event handling & delegation
- Fetch API
- DOM Manipulation with dynamic content
- SASS/SCSS
- RWD
- Basic Git workflow via CLI
